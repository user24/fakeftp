# fakeftp
A fake FTP server that echoes back the password used to connect to it.

So you need to know the FTP password, but it's just showing ****** in your client?

fakeftp to the rescue. Fire it up, edit the hostname to localhost in your client, and connect.

Your client connects to fakeftp, fakeftp logs the password in plain text in your console.

Hack the planet.
